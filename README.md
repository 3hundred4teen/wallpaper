# Wallpaper

Picking wallpaper is difficult, so it's time to bring the power of the internet to bear and crowdsource it instead!

Submit your tile into tiles as a 64x64 pixel PNG image and this script will hopefully slurp them up and turn them into an abominable mess of a wallpaper.

# Etiquette

I don't want too many rules, but put forth this simple code of etiquette:

* Unless it violates the etiquette, I've got to merge your PR
* Smut images are unimaginative, you're better than that
* Racist/hateful images are also unimaginative, seriously, why do I need to even say this?
* Trampling on other people's tiles is kinda mean, but if they're hogging the whole darn wallpaper they kinda deserve it
* Don't PR against the build.py unless you have a bugfix/improvement, I'm not dumb enough to automate it right out of git!

# Roadmap

What if ever image had an accompanying data file that dictated its x/y position/rotation, etc? Could we make this a crazy graffiti wall of transparent PNGs?
